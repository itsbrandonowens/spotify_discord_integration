This app seamlessly integrates Spotify and Discord, providing a unique platform where users can control their music and manage their Discord channels simultaneously. With real-time updates on currently playing tracks, including album artwork, users can play, pause, skip, and seek songs directly from the app. The Spotify integration allows for a fully immersive listening experience, while the Discord integration lets users see whoâ€™s in their channel, mute, deafen, and leave the channel without leaving the app. This project offers a smooth, unified interface for managing both music and communication in one place.
